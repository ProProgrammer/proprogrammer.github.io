![Hey it's me, Deep, at my childhood home.](/assets/profile.jpg)
Hi, I am Deep Sukhwani

I am a qualified Chartered Accountant from ACCA, UK. I pivoted into Software Engineering discipline after completing
 my accounting qualification.

I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Springboard](https://springboard.com){:target="_blank"} working on their backend web development
 team. I have always been fascinated by technology and especially web frameworks and web focused innovations.
 
I want to use this website to share a bit about myself, my everyday learning as I go through my life as a software
 developer and hopefully get a chance to interact with like minded people. 

It would be redundant to share my whole career journey here. I keep [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in
/DeepSukhwani){:target="_blank"} fairly up to date.

If you like my website, you can follow or come say Hi to me on twitter [@deepsukhwani](https://twitter.com
/deepsukhwani){:target="_blank"} and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/DeepSukhwani){:target="_blank"}.
